\begin{frame}{ITS = Complex System}
	A complex system is a system that exhibits some (and possibly all) of the following characteristics:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item A big/huge number of interactions among entities. 
	\item Different levels of abstraction.
	\item Hierarchical organization.
	\item Emergent organization.
	\item Local interactions and nonlinear relationships.
	\item System's components may be considered as complex systems.
	\item Feedback loops.
	\end{enumerate}
