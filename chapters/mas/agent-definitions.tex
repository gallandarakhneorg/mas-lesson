		\begin{definitionblock}{Agent \cite{Ferber.1999}}
			Agent is a virtual (software) or physical entity which:
			\begin{itemize}
			\item is capable of acting in an environment
			\item can communicate directly with other agents
			\item is driven by a set of tendencies (in the form of individual objectives or of a satisfaction/survival function which it tries to optimize)
			\item possesses resources of its own
			\item is capable to perceive its environment, but up to a limited extent
			\item has only a partial representation of this environment and perhaps none at all
			\item possesses skills and can offer services
			\item may be able to reproduce itself
			\item whose behavior tends towards satisfying its objectives, taking account of the resources and skills available to it and depending on its perception, its representation and the communication it receives
