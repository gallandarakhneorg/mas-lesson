	\begin{definitionblock}{Multiagent System \cite{Wooldridge09}}
	Multi-agent system is a system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents, where each agent has incomplete information or capabilities to solve a problem and thus must interact with others to achieve its goals or the system's goals

		System comprising the following elements: 
		\begin{itemize}
		\item An environment E, usually a space (may be with volume, 3D)
		\item An array of objects, $O$. These objects are situated
		\item A set of agents, $A$, which are specific objects
		\item A set of relations, $R$, which links the objects (and thus agents)
		\item A set of operations, $Op$, making it possible for agents to receive, produce, process and manipulate the objects in $O$
		\item Operators with the task of representing the application of these operations and the reaction of the world to this attempt of modification
