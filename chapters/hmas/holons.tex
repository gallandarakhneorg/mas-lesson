				\item[A whole] it has its own identity, autonomy and behaviour (seen from the outside as a single agent)
				\item[A part] it is a member of a larger holon (seen from the outside as a component of a system)

\begin{frame}{Properties of a Holon}
	\begin{block}{Four fundamental properties}
		\begin{description}
		\item[Self-similarity] A holon is structurally similar to its sub-holons; the same organisational patterns repeat at every level
		\item[Autonomy] Each holon can operate independently; it has its own goals, resources, and decision-making processes
		\item[Cooperativity] A holon cooperates with other holons at the same level and contributes to the goals of its super-holon
		\item[Recursiveness] The composition relationship applies recursively: a sub-holon may itself contain holons

	\begin{exampleblock}{Analogy}
		A \emph{cell} is a self-contained living entity \emph{and} a part of a tissue, which is a part of an organ, which is part of an organism

			\begin{description}
			\item[No absolute bottom] a leaf can always be decomposed further

			\item[Level of observation] determines what appears as atomic
			\item[Emergent properties] arise from the interactions within a holon
