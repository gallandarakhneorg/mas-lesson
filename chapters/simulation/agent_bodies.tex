	\begin{definition}[\cite{Saunier2015}]
	The agent body is a component of the multiagent system working as an \emph{interface between mind (agent) and environment}. It is \emph{embedded in the environment} to enforce body rules and ecological laws, but is \emph{influenced by -and allows introspection for- the mind}. An agent may have one or more bodies in the environment(s) it participates in
