	\begin{definitionblock}{Agent Environment \cite{weyns2007environment}}
		The environment is a first-class abstraction that provides the agents with a computational infrastructure and a set of services to facilitate agent interaction and situatedness.
	\end{definitionblock}
	
	\begin{block}{Properties}
		\begin{description}
		\item[Situatedness] Agents are situated in the environment; they perceive it through sensors and act upon it through actuators
		\item[Medium for interaction] The environment mediates all interactions among agents (indirect, e.g., stigmergy)
		\item[Active role] The environment is not merely a passive container; it has its own dynamics, laws, and computational processes independent of agents
		\item[Services provider] The environment offers services to agents (e.g., communication, coordination, spatial reasoning)

\begin{frame}{Missions of the Environment}
	\begin{description}
	\item<1->[M1 - Sharing informations] Environment is a shared structure for agents, where each of them perceives and acts.
	\item<2->[M2 - Managing perception and observation] Agents can manage the access to environmental informations and guarantee the partialness and localness of perceptions.
	\item<3->[M3 - Managing agents actions and interactions] It is related to the management of agents' simultaneous and joint actions and to the preservation of the environmental integrity: influence-reaction model \cite{Ferber96,Michel04,GallandGaudDemangeKoukam2009_11}.
	\item<4->[M4 - Maintaining endogenous dynamics] The environment is an active entity; it can have its own processes, independently of the ones of the agents.
