	abstract = {This paper presents the JaSIM environment model. It gathers experiences collected on design of the environment - as a first-class entity - coming from both multiagent and computer graphics domains. Its main goal consists in providing a sets of models and tools to easily implement crowd and traffic MABS. JaSIM integrates efficient hierarchical and graph-based data structures for supporting 1D to 3D actions and perceptions of numerous agents. It provides geometrical, topological and semantical data about environmental objects to agents. This paper discusses the overall architecture and 3D modules of JaSIM environment model, and illustrates platform performances on two experiments.},

	abstract = {Holonic multiagent systems (HMAS) offer a promising software engineering approach for developing complex open software systems. However the process of building Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and HMAS is mostly different from the process of building more traditional software systems as it introduces new design and development challenges. This paper introduces an agent-oriented software process for engineering complex systems called ASPECS. ASPECS is based on a holonic organisational metamodel and provides a step-by- step guide from requirements to code allowing the modelling of a system at different levels of details using a set of refinement methods. This paper details the entire ASPECS development process and provides a set of methodological guidelines for each process activity. A complete case study is also used to illustrate the design process and the associated notations. ASPECS uses UML as a modelling language. Because of the specific needs of agents and holonic organisational design, the UML semantics and notation are used as reference points, but they have been extended by introducing new specific profiles.},

The Global {CarPooling} Matching Service {(GCPMS)} shall advise registered candidates how to combine their commuting trips by carpooling. Planned periodic trips correspond to nodes in a graph; the edges are labeled with the probability for negotiation to merge two planned trips by carpooling. The probability values are calculated by a learning mechanism using on one hand the registered person and trip characteristics and on the other hand the negotiation feedback. The probability values vary over time due to repetitive execution of the learning mechanism. As a consequence, the matcher needs to cope with a dynamically changing graph bot with respect to topology and edge weights. In order to evaluate the matcher performance before deployment in the real world, it will be exercised using a large scale agent based model. This paper describes both the exercising model and the matcher.},

	abstract = {Carpooling can cut costs and help to solve congestion problems but does not seem to be popular. Behavioral models allow to study the incentives and inhibitors for carpooling and the aggregated effect on the transportation system. In activity based modeling used for travel forecasting, cooperation between actors is important both for schedule planning and revision. Carpooling requires cooperation while commuting which in turn involves co-scheduling and co-routing. The latter requires combinatorial optimization. Agent-based systems used for activity based modeling, contain large amounts of agents. The agent model requires helper algorithms that deliver high quality solutions to embedded optimisation problems using a small amount of resources. Those algorithms are invoked thousands of times during agent society evolution and schedule execution simulation. Solution quality shall be sufficient in order to guarantee realistic agent behavior. This paper focuses on the co-routing problem.},

	title = {An {Agent-Based} Model to Evaluate Carpooling at Large Manufacturing Plants},
	abstract = {Carpooling is thought to be part of the solution to resolve traffic congestion in regions where large companies dominate the traffic situation because coordination and matching between commuters is more likely to be feasible in cases where most people work for a single employer. Moreover, carpooling is not very popular for commuting. In order for carpooling to be successful, an online service for matching commuter profiles is indispensable due to the large community involved. Such service is necessary but not sufficient because carpooling requires rerouting and activity rescheduling along with candidate matching. We advise to introduce services of this kind using a two step process: (1) an agent-based simulation is used to investigate opportunities and inhibitors and (2) online matching is made available. This paper describes the challenges to build the model and in particular investigates possibilities to derive the data required for commuter behavior modeling from big data (such as {GSM,} {GPS} and/or Bluetooth).},

title = {Méthodologie de développement de systèmes multi-agents adaptatifs et conception de logiciels à fonctionnalité émergente},
school = {Universite Paul Sabatier de Toulouse III},
year = {2004},
abstract={
Les environnements des applications d'aujourd'hui sont de plus en plus complexes et dynami-ques, compte tenu du grand nombre et de la diversité des acteurs en jeu. Les fonctions de tels sys-tèmes deviennent alors de plus en plus difficiles à définir, et leur spécification est souvent incomplète, même si les composantes restent pleinement identifiables et spécifiables. Si de nouvelles mé-thodes de conception et de modélisation ne sont pas mises au point, la gestion des projets devien-dra de plus en plus contraignante, longue et coûteuse.
Nous proposons d'utiliser les systèmes multi-agents adaptatifs par auto-organisation coopéra-tive pour pallier ces problèmes de conception. La fonctionnalité de ces systèmes est une résultante émergeant des interactions coopératives entre agents. Toutefois, le développement de tels systè-mes est resté confidentiel et réduit à un groupe autour de ses créateurs directs. Certes de nombreu-ses applications ont été conçues grâce à ces systèmes, mais jamais par des novices, non experts du domaine. Pour répondre à ce manque de visibilité et d'ouverture, le projet ADELFE - pour Atelier de DEveloppement de Logiciels à Fonctionnalité Emergente - propose de développer une méthode de développement d'applications reposant sur ces principes et définie en trois points : un proces-sus, des notations et des outils. Le processus d'ADELFE est basé sur le Rational Unified Process et y ajoute des activités spécifiques à l'ingénierie orientée agent. Les notations sont une extension des notations UML et A-UML. Des outils ont été développés ou étendus afin de prendre en charge à la fois les notations, grâce à OpenTool, et le processus, grâce à un outil d'aide au suivi appelé Adelfe-Toolkit.
La pertinence de cette méthodologie a été mise à l'épreuve au cours de développements d'ap-plications diverses. Nous présentons ici les résultats obtenus pour un problème de résolution dy-namique d'emploi du temps, ETTO (pour Emergent Time Tabling Organisation), et pour un pro-blème de transport multi-robot de ressources

	agents are intended to be autonomous units of intelligent functionality.
	As a consequence, agent-based software engineering methods must complement

	address social knowledge and relationships but have high-level design
	abstractions as their end points. This paper describes PASSI a step-by-step
	requirement-to-code method for developing multiagent software that
	integrates design models and philosophies from both object-oriented
	software engineering and MAS using UML notation. The method has evolved
	through several stages; it has been previously applied in the synthesis

  abstract = {Many researchers have shown that there is no single best organization
	or coordination mechanism for all environments. This paper discusses
	the design and implementation of an extendable family of coordination
	mechanisms, called Generalized Partial Global Planning (GPGP). The
	set of coordination mechanisms described here assists in scheduling
	activities for teams of cooperative computational agents. The GPGP
	approach has several unique features. First, it is not tied to a
	single domain. Each mechanism is defined as a response to certain
	features in the current task environment. We show that different
	combinations of mechanisms are appropriate for different task environments.
	Secondly, the approach works in conjunction with an agent's existing
	local planner/scheduler. Finally, the initial set of five mechanisms
	presented here generalizes and extends the Partial Global Planning
	(PGP) algorithm. In comparison to PGP, GPGP allows more agent heterogeneity,
	it exchanges less global information, and it communicates at multiple
	levels of abstraction.}

	of three components: a reactive feedback control mechanism, a reactive
	plan execution mechanism, and a mechanism for performing time-consuming
	deliberative computations. These components run as separate computational
	processes. This is most easily accomplished by using a multi-tasking
	or multithreaded operating system, but can also be done my carefully
	coding the algorithms so they can be manually interleaved within
	a single computational process. In 3T the components are called the
	skill layer, the sequencing layer, and the planning layer respectively.
	In ATLANTIS these layers are called the controller, the sequencer,
	and the deliberator. The following discussion uses the ATLANTIS terminology,

  abstract = {We present the edge-Street/ edge-Rabin environment for doing verification
	using language containment. This environment has a number of desirable
	properties compared with the L-process/L-automaton environment ([Kur87b]),
	which is a practical language-containment-based formal verification
	environment: * It contains the L-environment as a subset. * It can
	be exponentially more compact than the L-environment. * We present
	BDD-based algorithms for main verification functions in this environment,
	and argue that they are efficient. Furthermore, if the specifications
	come from the L-environment, our algorithms reduce to the algorithms
	of [HTKB92] and [HBK93] for the L-environment. * It is in some sense
	maximal, i.e. language containment check for the next natural extension
	to our environment is NP-complete (as opposed to polynomial.) We
	have implemented our algorithms in our verification tool, and will
	present a flexible user interface to this environment.},

  year = {2004},
  abstract = { Dans cette these nous abordons des questions liees a la simulation
	informatique de systemes complexes modelises a l'aide du paradigme
	multi-agents. Cette approche repose sur l'idee qu'il est possible
	de representer directement le comportement et les interactions d'un
	ensemble d'entites autonomes evoluant dans un environnement commun.
	Mal maitrisee, la complexite des modeles consideres pose encore aujourd'hui
	de nombreux problemes quant a leur elaboration et a leur implementation.
	L'une des consequences les plus critiques reside dans la difficulte
	de reproduire fidelement les modeles publies dans la litterature.
	Ce qui pose le probleme de la verification et de la validation de
	ce type de simulations. Dans cette these, nous considerons que ce
	probleme est en majeure partie lie a un manque de correspondance
	entre les specifications des modeles et les structures informatiques
	qui permettent de les executer. Le but de nos travaux est de faire
	un pas vers une mise en correspondance effective de ces deux parties.
	Pour cela, nous considerons deux approches complementaires. La premiere
	se focalise sur l'elaboration d'outils generiques de conception de
	simulateurs. Il s'agit de rendre plus explicites les structures informatiques
	utilisees pour l'implementation. La deuxieme repose sur l'etude des
	moyens aujourd'hui utilises pour modeliser un systeme multi-agents.
	Dans ce cadre, nous proposons une reflexion globale sur ce paradigme
	et nous identifions un ensemble de contraintes liees a son utilisation.
	A partir de cette reflexion, nous proposons un principe de modelisation
	base sur l'approche Influence/Reaction et sur l'utilisation d'un
	modele formel d'environnement pour systemes multi-agents appele MIC*.
	Nous montrons en quoi notre approche permet de respecter les differentes
	contraintes de modelisation identifiees et nous illustrons sa faisabilite
	a l'aide d'un exemple concret. },

	perspective and a symbolic reasoning perspective; (b) the implementations
	of BDI agents >from an ideal theoretical perspective and a more practical
	perspective; and (c) the building of large-scale applications based
	on BDI agents. In particular, an air-traffic management application
	will be analyzed from both a theoretical and an implementation perspective.}

	a detailed understanding of how a new representational structure
	integrates into the cognitive and discursive flow of design, that
	is, whether it provides supportive or intrusive structure. This article
	presents a use-oriented analysis of a graphical argumentation notation
	known as QOC (Questions, Options, and Criteria). Through a series
	of empirical studies, we show that it provides most support when
	elaborating poorly understood design spaces, but is a distraction
	when evaluating well-constrained design spaces. This is explained
	in terms of the cognitive compatibility between argumentative reasoning
	and the demands of different modes of designing. We then provide
	an account based on the collaborative affordances of QOC in group
	design meetings, and extend this to discuss the evolution of QOC
	argumentation from short term working memory to long term group memory.},

  abstract = {Given a transition system and a cover $P$ of the set of its states,
	a set of local invariants with respect to $P$ is defined as a set
	of predicates in bijection with the set of the blocks of $P$ in such
	a way that a local invariant is true every time the system is in
	a state belonging to teh corresponding block of the cover. This definition
	is proved to be sufficiently general in the sense that any proof
	made by using global invariants can be also made by using sets of
	local invariants with respect to any cover $P$. The same result is
	proved for for two more restrictive definitions of the notion of
	local invariant by using well-known properties of connections between
	lattices. Finally, it is shown that the notion of invariant assertion,
	commonly used for proving programs can be deduced from the definition
	of local invariant when a transition system represents a program.
	In this case, the fixed point equations characterizing local invariants
	can be simplified to obtain semantical equations of programs.},

	abstract = {The recent ability of some vehicles to handle autonomously the lane change maneuvers, and the progressive equipment of roads and vehicles with ITS-G5 units motivate this paper to consider the case of road narrowing that requires a lane change because one lane is occupied by road works for maintenance, incidents and so on. This paper extends the approaches of cooperative speed synchronization at intersections. Because of the complexity of the overall system, it considers each automatic lane change as a mobile (unfixed) intersection in which vehicles synchronize their velocities. The wireless communication allows each vehicle to increase its field of view to negotiate its merging with the other equipped vehicles. Hence, the proposed approach introduces a kind of automatic “courtesy” between equipped vehicles. The paper defines the intersection point between each pair of vehicles and the suited protocol to safely reach the new lane. The protocol can be handled by the new work item (NWI) that has been created at ETSI to realize platooning and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides enhancing safety, the simulation results show that the main advantage of the approach is the energy saving by smoothing the traffic.},
